//! The decoder resolves a (map-dependent) location using its own map.
//! This map might differ from the one used during encoding.
//!
//! 1. Decode physical data and check its validity.
//! 2. For each location reference point find candidate nodes.
//! 3. For each location reference point find candidate lines.
//! 4. Rate candidate lines for each location reference point.
//! 5. Determine shortest-path(s) between two subsequent location reference points.
//! 6. Check validity of the calculated shortest-path(s).
//! 7. Concatenate shortest-path(s) to form the location and trim path according to the offsets.
